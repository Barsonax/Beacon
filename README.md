# Beacon
A TeamCity monitoring tool that uses a Delcom USB LED light to notify your teams

# Why another
My original idea was triggered by [TeamFlash](https://github.com/Readify/TeamFlash), a prototype implementation made by Readify. However, the quality of that code was way below anything I can work with, so I planned to contribute a big list of improvements as well as more configuration options. However, it took me several emails, tweets and DMs and a month of patience just to get a [single pull request](https://github.com/Readify/TeamFlash/pull/16) accepted. So I see no point in working with a fork. Instead, I decided to take their code as a starting point and revive the product. 

# Backlog
* Support for multiple levels of power per state
* Support for including all TeamCity projects under a certain project node, including more advanced filtering rules. 
* A Chocolatey package
